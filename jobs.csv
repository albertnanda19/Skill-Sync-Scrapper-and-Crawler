Separately, we also buy and grow businesses that are leaders in their niches.  
  
WHO WE ARE & HOW WE OPERATE  
We're a hard-driving, fast-paced team of continuous improvers—a team, not a family—hiring and developing stars (leaders) in every role. We live by six core beliefs that drive massive success:

**Remarkable**: Go the extra mile to create jaw-dropping experiences (JDCE) that turn first-timers into re-order loyalists-we're in the reorder business. Develop unique superpowers; do what competitors won't.

**Adaptable**: Lifelong learners who grow or die-learn fast, fail fast, grab ideas anywhere, simplify everything, and proactively fix/improve everything around you.

**Accountable**: Own your outcomes like it's your company - be demanding yet supportive, 100% responsibility, share updates in Slack/Kustomer (our collective brain), own mistakes and fix them fast.

**Speed is King**: Act now over perfection; good executed today beats perfect next week. Maniacal urgency, get sh\\*t done measurably, predisposed to action and efficiency.

**Don't Sugar Coat It**: Tell the truth straight - tough talks help growth; - uncomfortable conversations fuel progress; no avoidance, speak up respectfully.

**Humble**: Think of the business first - admit gaps, share wins, own losses, pick what's right over who's right.
